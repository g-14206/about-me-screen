  <h1> About Me! </h1> 
  
  <p> Welcome to She Quilts Alot! </p>
  <p> My name is Peta Peace and I’m a quilter who’s been making and creating for 14 years.   
  That seems like such a long time and when I look back it sure is a lot of quilts! </p>

  <p> When I’m not sewing and quilting I am a wife to my super spunky best friend Richard (he seriously is!) and a Mum to 
  our two beautiful girls.  Somewhere in all of that I also run my own non quilt related business. </p>
  <p> We are lucky enough to call Brisbane, Australia home.   I love the small town feel of this city and the fantastic weather we have…
  except in January & February when the really high humidity hits and my hair goes crazy! </p>
  <p> I hope you enjoy this little blog.  If you have any questions, or just want to say hi!, I’d love to hear from you. </p>
